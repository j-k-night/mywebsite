		<p class = "reflection">The most important thing I gained from this course is experience using Javascript to manipulate web pages and validate forms. Prior to this class I was familiar with HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript programming - such as variables, loops, etc. - but during this class I gained experience making dynamic web pages that, for example, respond to user input by adding new elements to the page.</p>
